  Hello, my name is Jake Bissen. 
  The project that I am working on is a simple search engine made to find and locate user specific gifs on the web. 
Upon entering a topic (like "dog"), and proceeding to hit the submit button, the user will get a gif of a dog. They can also retap the submit button
to randomly generate more gifs of the same category.
While offering a simplistic feel in a world of constant pop ups and chaotic imagery, my site is made to provide clarity, with ease of use. 
Simply enter in the search bar what you are looking for, and the gif(s) will appear if they exist. 
    I used Css, Javascript, HTML, and Sass to aid me in this project. 
I also used a bit of Json (although not directly used) to help me add my repos. 

  I have a few ideas to make my site better.
One of witch is to add a D&D (Dungeons and Dragons, a TTRPG) monster randomizer. 
This would allow both new and expiercend DMs (dungeon masters) to have a chance to find randomly generated monsters. 
There will be options to add a CR range, creatue numbers, and discription/encounter ideas for said monsters. 
I would also like to add a dice roller and a option to create a loot randomizer, of witch the latter has already been added within another page. 

This site currently acts as a test to see how I can use APIs (public or custom) to make generators and content.
